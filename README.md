# **WALMART SALES FORECASTING** 

This project focuses on forecasting Walmart's weekly sales using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.  
By analyzing historical sales data, holiday events, and promotions, we build predictive models to improve demand planning and inventory optimization.

## **TECHNOLOGIES USED**
- **Language:** Python  
- **Data Processing:** pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, KNN  
- **Deep Learning:** LSTM (TensorFlow, Keras)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** MAE, RMSE, RÂ² Score

## **KEY INSIGHTS**
- Identified seasonal trends and holiday effects on sales  
- Built and compared multiple ML & DL models  
- LSTM achieved the best performance, reducing RMSE by ~53% compared to Linear Regression
